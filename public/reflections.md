## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Comparison Operators**
Comparison operators are symbols used in programming to compare two values. They include operators like ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=. These operators return a boolean value (true or false), which makes them very useful in decision-making statements such as if conditions. I understand this topic well because I can easily identify which operator to use depending on the type of comparison needed.

2. **Control Statements**
Control statements allow the flow of a program to change depending on certain conditions. It includes if, else if, else, and switch statements, which help the program decide what action to perform. They are essential because they prevent a program from running infinitely with no end and instead make it respond to different inputs or situations. I am confident with this topic because I know how to structure conditions properly and predict the outcome.

3. **Loop Control Structure (while, do while, for..in)**
Loop control structures repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. A while loop checks the condition first before executing, while a do while loop executes at least once before checking the condition. The for..in loop is useful for iterating through object properties or collections. I am comfortable with this topic because I can apply the correct type of loop depending on the problem I am solving.

4. **Variable Declaration**
Variable declaration is the process of creating a variable to store data in memory. In programming languages, we use keywords such as var, let, or const to declare variables. Declaring variables properly is important because it defines the scope and value of the data stored. I understand this topic well because I can identify when to use each type of variable declaration effectively.

5. **Logical Operators**
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean value. The most common logical operators are && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT). These operators are especially important in writing complex conditions for decision-making in programs. I am confident in this topic because I can apply logical operators to make my conditions more efficient and accurate.


## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **JavaScript Overview and Syntax**
I know the basic overview and syntax of JavaScript, such as statements, semicolons, and case sensitivity. However, I need more practice in fully understanding how different parts of the syntax connect, especially when writing longer programs. Sometimes I get confused about when to use certain structures or the proper way to format code for readability.

2. **Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects**
I am familiar with JavaScript Number objects like Math.random(), Math.floor(), or Number.parseInt(). But I still need more practice in using them effectively in different scenarios. I sometimes forget which method is best for a particular case, and I want to be more confident in applying them without relying too much on references.

3. **Declaring Functions**
I understand the basic concept of declaring functions in JavaScript, whether using function declarations or function expressions. However, I still need more practice in applying them with parameters, return values, and especially arrow functions. I want to get better at knowing when to use each type of function and how to organize them in bigger programs.

4. **Event Handlers**
I know that event handlers are used to make web pages interactive by responding to user actions like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements. While I can explain how they work, I need further practice in writing them properly and connecting them with HTML elements. I also want to practice handling multiple events at the same time, as this can sometimes get confusing.

5. **Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop)**
I know the purpose of break, continue, and nested loops in JavaScript. However, I sometimes find it challenging to apply them correctly in complex situations, especially when multiple loops are involved. I need more practice to become comfortable in deciding when to use these control statements without making logical errors in my code.


## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

To help myself understand the topics better, I will do the following steps for my plan of action:
1. I will practice regularly. I will set aside time to write short codes every day so I can get used to applying the lessons, instead of just memorizing them.
2. I will maximize and use online resources. I will watch tutorials, read documentation, and check coding forums when I get confused, so I can see more examples and explanations.
3. I will answer more coding exercises and sample problems from class or online so I can strengthen my understanding and remember the lessons better.
4. I will not hesitate to ask my teacher or classmates whenever I donâ€™t understand something. Talking about the lessons will help me see different approaches.
5. I will go back to old topics regularly, try to solve problems again, and reflect on my mistakes so I can avoid repeating them in the future.


## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

**Effective Activities:**
1. Coding Exercises - These were effective because they allowed me to apply the lessons right away. Writing code helped me understand the concepts better and remember them longer.
2. Speedtest - The speedtests were also effective since they helped me recall topics quickly and improved my familiarity with JavaScript syntax under time pressure.

**Not Effective Activities:**
1. Lessons with Fewer Examples - When there were only one or two examples, it was not as effective for me. I learn better when I see different examples showing how the concept works in multiple situations.
2. Rushed Activities - Some activities felt too fast and didnâ€™t give enough time to process the lesson. Because of that, I wasnâ€™t able to practice properly and needed more time to understand.
