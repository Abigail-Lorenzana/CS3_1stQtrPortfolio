### My 2 paragraphs of reflection 
> What separates fiction from reality is just one headline. SONA (State of the Nation Address) is an important annual event that everyone waits for, wherein it serves as a means to inform us Filipinos of the condition or state of our nation through listening to our current president, BBM, address these concerns. Many people are split on the content of this event as it discusses the important updates that affect our daily lives, just like me, who is a Filipino citizen and a Pisay scholar, wherein our role is there to find the untarnished truth and to be able to decipher through our factual checking whenever we hear the news to avoid bias. We all have our own opinions, as he mentions many insightful topics such as our economy, jobs, agriculture, education, infrastructure, and health.

> As a Pisay scholar, my take on the topics he covered overall is that although he mentioned many of the updates are true and that it matches the rates recorded, there were still a few that he could’ve given more context to and some may even be misleading as the statements such as the “20 pesos per kilo rice” implementation which I think are not actually applied in most of the areas in the Philippines and the farmers condition on these are still quite unstable. Additionally, PhilHealth is said to be giving free healthcare services to people, however, if you look through some hospitals, there are still people who wait in long lines because some would say that the systems are not yet updated in these implications and would sometimes take time. Although these examples were statements from him that are misleading, there are others that I wish he could’ve given more context on, just like the recent floods as we needed to hear more details on crucial topics that are relevant to our lives as we experience many problems in our country, wherein he could’ve discussed how to prevent them. Overall, watching the SONA gave me a lot of insights on all these topics that are very important to know especially since it affects us in our daily lives and that we have to work together as a nation who simply wants peace and order in our beloved country, wherein I also learned to be more aware of important issues that should be addressed and voices of the Filipinos who wants to be heard.

### 1 sentence I have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025
Sapat ba ang mga salita kung kulang sa aksyon para sa ating kinabukasan?
